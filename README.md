NEXAA - Next-Gen AI Association 
This is a landing page I built for the CSE (AI & ML) Department. My main goal was to mix a "Royal" look with a high-tech vibe using a clean frontend structure.

Frontend Approach
I wanted to see how far I could push a project using Pure HTML5 and CSS3.
Zero JavaScript: Everything you see including the scrolling announcements and interactive overlays is built entirely without JS.
Modern Grids: I used CSS Grid to create the "Bento-style" event cards and a custom "Mosaic Gallery" to keep the layout feeling fresh and professional.
Smooth Motion: All the animations are powered by CSS @keyframes for a lightweight and lag-free experience.
Performance: Because there’s no heavy scripting, the site loads instantly.

Tech Stack
HTML5: Clean, semantic structure.
CSS3: Used CSS Variables for easy theme management, along with Flexbox and Grid for the layout.
Fonts: A professional pairing of Cinzel for headings and Montserrat for body text.
Developed by Saisri Gandla. Just a frontend dev who loves building clean, fast, and visually sharp web interfaces.
